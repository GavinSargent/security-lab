I am going to write about a recent data breach. The Sony Pictures data breach the happened in November 2014. Sony was targeted because of their upcoming movie "The Interview". This movie was considered controversial. The hackers got in through one server and were able to acess the majority of Sony's system. They leaked millions of GB of information to the public. The hackers were able to get into the entire network due to a lack of secondary defenses in their system as well as weak passwords. The hackers actually released information showing that three of the passwords in the system were actually "password". Since the leak, Sony has strengthened their internal system as well as paid reparations to the employee's whose personal information was stolen and leaked.
